        <h2>Achievment Week</h2>
        <p>
            Originally designed to promote the study of Negro life and history. Achievement Week is observed in November of each year and is designed to seek out and give due recognition to those individuals at the local and international levels who have made a noteworthy contribution toward improving the quality of life for black Americans. A High School Essay Contest is held in conjunction with Achievement Week. This contest is open to all college-bound high school seniors. College scholarships are awarded to the winners, each of whom must submit an essay on a theme/topic chosen by the fraternity. This contest is a phase of the International Achievement Week observance.

        <h2>HEALTH INITIATIVES</h2>
        <p>
            All levels of the fraternity are expected to facilitate, participate and/or coordinate activities that will uplift their communities by promoting good health practices. An international committee will coordinate and facilitate multifaceted programs of the various chapters, districts, etc. It is anticipated that all local chapters will execute the health directives at the local level. Some of the programs under the umbrella of Health Initiatives are the Charles Drew Blood Drive (normally held in June), AIDS/HIV Awareness, and the American Diabetes Association Partnership. This does not prevent the local chapters from performing additional health initiatives under the umbrella of the Health Initiatives mandate.
        </p>
        <h2>VOTER REGISTRATION, EDUCATION AND MOBILIZATION</h2>
        <p>
            All levels of the fraternity are expected to facilitate, participate and/or coordinate activities that will uplift their communities through the power of the vote. An international committee will coordinate and facilitate multifaceted programs of the various chapters, districts, etc. It is anticipated that all local chapters will execute the directives at the local level. This does not prevent the local chapters from performing additional voter initiatives under the umbrella of the Voter Education, Registration and Mobilization mandate.
        </p>
        <h2>NAACP</h2>
        <p>
            Every district and chapter of the fraternity is required to maintain a Life Membership at Large in the NAACP. In the event that a chapter or district is not a life member of the NAACP, it must maintain a yearly
            membership to be in good standing with the fraternity. Furthermore, all members of the fraternity are strongly encouraged to become members of the NAACP.
